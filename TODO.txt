COMPLETED TASKS
===============

✅ refactor server.py - Added namespace prefixes to all 47 tools
   - All tools now use namespaced naming convention
   - Format: phase_action (e.g., backtesting_run, optimization_run)
   - Organized by trading phase for better discoverability

✅ add namespace at the URI level
   - Implemented MCP-compliant tool naming with underscore separators
   - Tools grouped by phase: backtesting_, optimization_, risk_, pairs_, trading_, strategy_, cache_, etc.
   - All tools pass MCP validation (no special characters in names)

FUTURE REFACTORING OPPORTUNITIES
================================

- Extract tools into separate modules (jesse_mcp/tools/backtesting.py, etc.)
  for better organization and maintainability
- Consider HTTP namespace routing if upgrading to OpenAPI-style API
- Add tool grouping metadata for better LLM discoverability
