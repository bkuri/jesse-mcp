# 🚀 Parallel Development Quick Start

## Ready to Launch!

Your parallel development system is now set up with:

### 📁 **Created Files**
- ✅ **PRD_v1.0.0.md** - Centralized strategy development framework
- ✅ **agent-a-strategy-dev.md** - Strategy Development Specialist (temp 0.2)
- ✅ **agent-b-backtest-analysis.md** - Backtesting & Analysis Specialist (temp 0.7)
- ✅ **agent-c-risk-management.md** - Risk Management Specialist (temp 0.3)
- ✅ **parallel-development.sh** - Multi-agent orchestration script

### 🎯 **Launch Commands**

```bash
# Start parallel development session
cd ~/source/jesse-mcp
./scripts/parallel-development.sh start

# Check agent status
./scripts/parallel-development.sh status

# Stop all agents
./scripts/parallel-development.sh stop

# Show help
./scripts/parallel-development.sh help
```

### 🔄 **Development Workflow**

**Phase 1: Foundation**
1. Review PRD_v1.0.0.md for your strategy requirements
2. Launch Agent A (Strategy Development) to implement core strategies
3. Launch Agent B (Backtesting) to test and validate strategies
4. Launch Agent C (Risk Management) to ensure safety compliance

**Phase 2: Integration**
1. Agents work in parallel on their specialized domains
2. Shared state management coordinates inter-agent communication
3. Continuous monitoring tracks progress and identifies bottlenecks
4. Centralized PRD ensures consistent direction and quality

### 🎛️ **Agent Profiles**

- **Agent A (prd_executor)**: Temp 0.2, Model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.6
  - Precise execution of PRD specifications
  - Strategy implementation and optimization
  
- **Agent B (prd_iterator)**: Temp 0.7, Model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.6
  - Analytical iteration and performance improvement
  - Backtesting and statistical validation
  
- **Agent C (suspension_analyzer)**: Temp 0.3, Model zai-coding-plan/glm-4.5-flash
  - Conservative analysis and learning from suspensions
  - Risk assessment and safety validation

### 📊 **Expected Benefits**

- **3x Faster Development**: Parallel execution vs sequential
- **Higher Quality**: Specialized agents focus on their domains
- **Better Coordination**: Centralized PRD provides clear direction
- **Risk Management**: Built-in safety controls and validation
- **Scalable Architecture**: Easy to add new agents or strategies

### 🚀 **Getting Started**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd ~/source/jesse-mcp

# Launch your parallel development session
./scripts/parallel-development.sh start

# The system will:
# 1. Launch 3 specialized agents simultaneously
# 2. Monitor their progress automatically
# 3. Coordinate their work via shared state
# 4. Provide real-time status updates
```

### 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Customize PRD**: Edit PRD_v1.0.0.md with your specific strategy requirements
2. **Add Strategies**: Create new strategy folders with individual PRDs
3. **Monitor Progress**: Use status command to track agent progress
4. **Iterate**: Update PRDs based on agent insights and performance data

Your parallel development system is ready to accelerate strategy creation while maintaining quality and safety! 🎯
